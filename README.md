## Overview
In this project, teams are assigned to design an arena and exploit the mapping and navgation capabilities of the AgileX LIMO which is based on ROS (Robot Operating System).

## Key Aspects
- Uses ROS Melodic (Ubuntu 18.04)
- ARM-based hardware (Nvidia Jetson Nano)
- LiDAR and depth vision-based sensing (YDLIDAR XL2 & Orbbec Dabai)
- RViz visualization

## Why ROS?
- Open-source software frameworks: Provides users with the flexibility when choosing tools and libraries for use with their application, all while being free and supported by a large community.
- Large user base: Widespread use from universities to industries as a result of its open-source nature.
